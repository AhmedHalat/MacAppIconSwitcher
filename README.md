 Switches yout Mac Application Icons
 
 ## TODO
 - Create a script to revert images to backup

## Preparation
- Place AppIconInstaller.sh inside the folder with your app icons
- Don't worry about the backup folder, if one doesn't exist, it will be created

## Running
- Open terminal and change run AppIconInstaller.sh 
 - If you are unsure how to run it type "sh " then drag AppIconInstaller.sh onto the terminal line, this will automatically input the path name.
 - It should look like ``` sh PATH/AppIconInstaller.sh```
 - Type in your password when prompted
